* You can use "sh. / train_Total_Text_WSR.sh" and "sh ./train_ICDAR2013_TCB.sh" to train the word stroke network and the text center block network, respectively.


* You can run "train_CTW1500_Total_MCFE.sh", "train_CTW1500_Total_BLSTM.sh", and "train_CTW1500_Total_Attention.sh", respectively, to generate the prediction of text center block region, to verify the influence of MCFE,BLSTM, and Attention module on the proposed model.
